### What helped you this week?
- Switching from devcontainers from devbox
- Reading the book

- We have a front end with media hands running
- A backend that can process data from the frontend and parse it to our model
- A first iteration of the model that works on letters
    
### What did you struggle with?

### What would you like to work on next week?
- Figure our how we are going to process video
    - How would it work in the frontend
    - How would we process an extra dimension for the landmarks (a period of time (video))
    - How long should a video be
    - Probably start to move away from using the book examples for our project
			
    
### Where do you need help from Veronika?
- Any books you can recommend besides the ones we are already using.
- Any tips from going from processing static image data, to video data.
