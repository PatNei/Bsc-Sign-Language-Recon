## Date: 26th March 2024 

### What helped you this week?
- Confidence boost from passing a very hard exam :D

### What did you achieve?
- Dockerized our application.
- CSV parsing.
- Started writing on the report.

### What did you struggle with?


### What would you like to work on next week?
- Improve Frontend by hiding capturing modes.
- Combining our dynamic and static model into one.
- Creating binary classifiers for all letters.



### Where do you need help from Amelia?
- What are good experiments? 

### What are the agreements after this meeting? (to fill in after the meeting)


## Date: 14th March 2024 

### What helped you this week?
-  Whiteboards

### What did you achieve?
- Trajectory classifier, "fist-up" or "fist-down"?
- Dockerized the application
- Extracting "key frames" from a image sequence.

### What did you struggle with?
- Getting an appropriate amount of frames from a sequence to satisfy the model.
- VITE

### What would you like to work on next week?
- Report writing, detailing our progress so far, classifying the first dynamic sign.
- Enable support for using two hands.
- Deploy it.

### Where do you need help from Amelia?
- Extracting "good" key frames, any tips?
- How do we train a model that isn't that sensitive to the amount of features?
  - Our first model always expected exactly 12+1 framesðŸ˜­

### What are the agreements after this meeting? (to fill in after the meeting)
- 

## Date: 5th March 2024 

### What helped you this week?
- 

### What did you achieve?
- Optimized hyper parameters for multiclass model (and binary classifier) for ASL alphabet
- we implemented simple trajectories, reducing the hand to a single point
- Learning app (frontend) is now able to capture sequences of landmarks and send them off to the API.

### What did you struggle with?
- Python & React

### What would you like to work on next week?
- Creating a trajectory classifier.

### Where do you need help from Amelia?
- What are the limits of a multiclass classification model? (How would it scale with a 1000 classes?)
- How much math should be put into the report?

### What are the agreements after this meeting? (to fill in after the meeting)
-  Consider loss functions (Sci-kit magic)
	-  No blackbox
-  Consider how our application/model relates to our research question
-  Consider whether multiclass classification or binary classification is the right approach to solve our goal with the research question.
	- _Test both options_
 	- Do we care about storage issues, prediction time and available data.
 - Bring some metrics for next time. (confusion metrics,precision and accuracy)


## Date: 29th February 2024 

### What helped you this week?
- Being informed about grlib python library

### What did you achieve?
- We remade the frontend and added duolingo features.
- We analyzed and made a plan for how to handle dynamic gestures.

### What did you struggle with?
- Re-exam for the whole group
- Struggled with grlib (python library for gesture detection)

### What would you like to work on next week?
- See: [Implement model that supports motion](https://github.com/PatNei/Bsc-Sign-Language-Recon/issues/10)

### Where do you need help from Amelia?

### What are the agreements after this meeting? (to fill in after the meeting)
- Send the report to Amelia before the deadline maybe two weeks before. (can add to overleaf)
- Amelia isn't available at 15:30 but is available at 15:00
- Fill out weekly meetings before the weekly meeting (a day before)

### What are the agreements after this meeting? (to fill in after the meeting)
- Keep on working with the dynamic processing

## Date: 15th February 2024 
### If relevant, your supervisor will ask Lottie to add you to the group purrlab_students on ITU's HPC, where you will be able to find both raw and preprocessed datasets.
Are there any data relevant for our project
	
### Who did you help this week?
...
    
### What helped you this week?
- Switching from devcontainers to devbox
- Reading the book
	
### What did you achieve?
- We have a front end with media hands running
- A backend that can process data from the frontend and parse it to our model
- A first iteration of the model that works on letters
    
### What did you struggle with?
- FastAPI
- Dev environments
- It was hard to take an image from the computer and make it work on the model from the book

### What would you like to work on next week?
- Figure our how we are going to process video
    - How would it work in the frontend
    - How would we process an extra dimension for the landmarks (a period of time (video))
    - How long should a video be
    - Probably start to move away from using the book examples for our project	
    
### Where do you need help from Amelia?
- Any books you can recommend besides the ones we are already using.
- Any tips from going from processing static image data, to video data.
    
### What are the agreements after this meeting? (to fill in after the meeting)
- Show confusion matrix
- Begin writing project
